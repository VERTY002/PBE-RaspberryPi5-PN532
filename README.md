**PBE (Basic Project of Engineering)** is a course which I am taking in my third year of my degree in Telecommunications Engineering at UPC School of Telecommunications Engineering (ETSETB).

This group project develops an Internet of Things client application that communicates with a server connected to a database.

**-Parts of the project:**

**First Puzzle:** Using the Python3 language, implement a program that prints an uid-user identifier via console.

**Second Puzzle:** Create a graphic version of the First Puzzle.

**Critical Design Review (CDR):** Design an application similar to a moodle, in our case the one of our university UPC called Atenea. 
                              This application allows consulting the assignments, the timetable or the grades of a given student with an associated UID.
                              This involves the creation of the server(PHP), the client (Python3) ,the database (SQL) and styles (CSS).

**-Resources and gadgets needed for the project:**

In order to develop this project I used a Raspberry Pi 5 a PN532 NFC lector and a laptop.

All the information and resources such as libraries and tutorials are in the Reports (PDF).
