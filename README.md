PBE (Basic Project of Engineering) is a course which I am taking in my third year of my degree in Telecommunications Engineering at UPC School of Telecommunications Engineering (ETSETB).

This project develops an Internet of Things client application that communicates with a server connected to a database.

-Parts of the project:

First Puzzle: Using the Python3 language, implement a program that prints a uid-user identifier via console.

Second Puzzle: Create a graphic version of the First Puzzle.
Critical Design Review (CDR): Design an application similar to a moodle, in our case the one of our university UPC called Atenea. 
                              This application allows consulting the assignments, the timetable or the grades of a given student with an associated UID.
                              This involves the creation of the server(PHP), the client (Python3) and the data base (SQL).

-Resources and gadgets needed for the project:

In order to develop this project I used a Raspberry Pi 5 a PN532 NFC lector and a laptop.

All the information and resources such as libraries and tutorials are in the Reports (PDF).
